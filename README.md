# Women in Tech (India) :woman:

Hey there! This repository is for storing everything any girl would look for or need while on her journey in the field of Computer Science.
I'm hoping this will help all the young girls across India, and encourage them to pursue the field further. 

If you want to explore the world of Computer Science, this is the place to be! Explore the contents of this repository by going through the table of contents given below. :sparkles:


A great quote by Ara Katz, _Chief Marketing Officer at Spring_:
> “There is no recipe, there is no one way to do things — there is only your way. And if you can recognize that in yourself
> and accept and appreciate that in others, you can make magic.”
