# Women in Tech (India)

Hey there! This repository is for storing everything any girl would look for or need while on her journey in the field of Computer Science.
I'm hoping this will help all the young girls across India, and encourage them to pursue the field further.

## Different Fields in Computer Science 
### 1. Computer Science Theory
  * Algorithms and Data Structures : Studying different algorithms and data structures used in programming.
    * Algorithms
    * Data structures
    * Analysis of Algorithms ( Complexities of time and space etc)
    * Computational Geometry
    * Combinatorial Optimization
    
  * Theory of Computation : Deals with how to compute things on a computer
    * Automata theory
    * Computability theory
    * Complexity theory
    * Quantum Computation
    * Cryptography
    
  * Information science
    * Information theory (representing information, quantifying it)
    * Coding theory (compression, correction, error detection etc)
    
  * Programming Language theory : Deals with how to develop a programming language
    * Type theory (How to represent “types” of data)
    * Compiler design (How to design compilers and interpreters which help computer understand the language)
    * Programming languages
    
   * Formal Methods: Deals with formal specifications required for hardware and software
   
   
### 2. Systems Theory

  * Computer Architecture and engineering: Principles behind organizing and building a computer
    * Digital logic: performing operations with 0s and 1s on hardware
    * Micro Architecture (Processors, FPGAs)
    * Multi Processing (Pipelines, Multi core systems)
    * Ubiquitous Computing ( Simplify the idea of computing and make it available in all devices like cell phone, palmtops notebooks etc.)
    * Systems Architecture ( Principle behind designing computer systems using systems engineering approaches)
    * Operating Systems (Study of operating systems which are like a bridge between hardware and software
    
  * Performance analysis: Study involving analysing performance of computer systems and come up with solutions to improve it.
  
  * Parallel and distributed systems: Study involving how to parallelise and distribute the computing using a large number of resources instead of a single computer.
  * Computer Networks: Study of organizing computers into networks and communication within a network and between networks.
  
  * Computer Security: Study of principles behind giving various securities to computer users and their information.
  
  * Databases: Study involving developing databases which are entities responsible for storing, managing and processing data.
  
  
### 3. Computer Applications

  * Computer graphics: Generate images, videos and animations ( visual content) for games, movies etc
  
  * HCI: Study involving principles and techniques employed in Human computer interaction.
  
  * Scientific computing: Utilising computers to analyze and simulate scientific problems
    * Numeric analysis
    * Bioinformatics
    * Computational Physical sciences ( Physics and Chemistry)
  
  * Artificial Intelligence: Study involving making computers intelligent like humans ( probably most popular of all the fields)
    * Pattern recognition
    * Machine learning
    * Data mining
    * Natural language processing, Computer Vision
    * Knowledge representation ( how to represent and quantify knowledge) and reasoning
    * Robotics
    
    
 ### 4. Software Engineering
 
  * Study of designing, implementing, and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build.
  * Also study about organizing and analyzing software
