  * Programming Language theory : Deals with how to develop a programming language
    Description: A branch of ComputerScience which deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of ProgrammingLanguages and programming language features. It is a multi-disciplinary field, both depending on (and in some cases affecting) mathematics, software engineering, linguistics, and even the cognitive sciences. It is a well-recognized branch of computer science, and an active research area.
    * Type theory (How to represent “types” of data)

   * Formal Methods: Deals with formal specifications required for hardware and software
   
     [Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods)
     Formal methods are techniques used to model complex systems as mathematical entities. By building a mathematically rigorous model of a complex system, it is      possible to verify the system's properties in a more thorough fashion than empirical testing.
