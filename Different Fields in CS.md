   * Formal Methods: Deals with formal specifications required for hardware and software
   
     [Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods)
    
     Formal methods are techniques used to model complex systems as mathematical entities. By building a mathematically rigorous model of a complex system, it is      possible to verify the system's properties in a more thorough fashion than empirical testing.

### 2. Systems Theory

  * Computer Architecture and engineering: Principles behind organizing and building a computer
  
    Description: Computer architecture is a specification describing how hardware and software technologies interact to create a computer platform or system. When we think of the word architecture, we think of building a house or a building. Keeping that same principle in mind, computer architecture involves building a computer and all that goes into a computer system. 
    * Digital logic: performing operations with 0s and 1s on hardware
    * Micro Architecture (Processors, FPGAs)
    * Multi Processing (Pipelines, Multi core systems)
    * Ubiquitous Computing ( Simplify the idea of computing and make it available in all devices like cell phone, palmtops notebooks etc.)
    * Systems Architecture ( Principle behind designing computer systems using systems engineering approaches)
    * Operating Systems (Study of operating systems which are like a bridge between hardware and software

  * Computer Networks: Study of organizing computers into networks and communication within a network and between networks.
  
    Description: A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.
