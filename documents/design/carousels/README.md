# Links for carousels:

[Homepage, Organizations, The World of CS](https://www.figma.com/file/Zmn4P7WGr3pBkPsBPc0uIX/Carousels?node-id=0%3A1) by Bharati
## Org promoting WiT
1. This has a vertical scroller to look through organizations that promote WiT. I reduced opacity in the 1st and 3rd org to show that they are not in focus. Since I didn't have content, I just put aboit org 1 and a small description with Lorem Ipsum and then a button that maybe has hte organization's landing page

2. Designs with hero and sub hero texts along with a division that provides a list of org that can be chosen. When you select an org it's small description along with an image appears in the right of the div, with a button to navigate to the org's landing page.

## Homepage
1. Carousel including the header. The header is hidden by hamburger in the right top of the frame. and the carousel image is represented by the circles in the bottom right. Where light color indicates the image in focus (carousel navigator). The icons for discord, github and other sites can be placed in the bottom left. (no need for the bg rectangle. I just added that for simplicity). The Hero text appeara vertically in the page Left center. And any additional hero and sub hero text covers a part of the image and also the free space available in the bg.

2. Also made a header + carousel. with a navigation bar containing both arrows and circles to change/navigate to a particular carousel. Additionally social media icons + hero text and/ or sub hero text.

## World of CS
The third is also kind of a carousel but for the world of cs. The technology image (for .e.g web dev) can appear on top of the white frame along with tech name placed vertically in the left.  The black color bg is constant for all technologies, but the skin color in the left can be changed for each of the tech. E.g. skin for web dev, yellow for mobile dev, pink for Data science, blue for ML and so on. Additionally text explainaing the tech and also a button that could take the user to another page containing a list of resources.
